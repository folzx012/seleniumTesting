Letter from John Muir to A. Bradley Brown, 1856","
18 yrs old:Letter to a friend, Hickory Hill Wis, 1856.Dear Bradley, I wrote you a long letter a day or two ago, with a supplement; but it was till too short; I shall endeavor to finish it now You remember I mentioned your belief in Jesus Christ as our Saviour. Now what should follow from so great a belief, and what does it signify? Just suppose Bradley, that you are a traveler; You have long been wandering here and there in rough thorny places homeless and friendless; your father is dead, and your mother is dead; you have not one friend to help you or take pity on you; you are an outcast, poor, hopeless, forsaken. It has been a bitter stormy day; since morning you have been urging your toilsome way against the sleety beast. Now the darkness thickens. It is night, and such a night. Hark how the storm shrieks and wails through the gloomy wood as the [illegible] wind blows through the bending branches, its voice rising &amp; falling in long-drawn dismal cadence

Hark how the storm shrieks and wails through the gloomy wood as the [illegible] wind blows through the bending branches, its voice rising &amp; falling in long-drawn dismal cadence
The storm seems to be seeking you out as if aimed at you alone of all the wretches out that night. Your life's blood is chilled. How strangely the tales of perished travelers fasten on your sinking heart. Shall you out live the fearful night? A light! A light! Ah see how it blazes from long rows of windows tier above tier through the storm-laden darkness. You will not perish, Hope returns. Your almost motionless heart beats hard again sending thin watery blood through your benumbed limbs. Struggle on Bradley you shall yet be warmed &amp; fed and sheltered. You approach feeble, and bent, and dripping; the big lighted front of the mansion seems forbiddingly grand. Hark how the joyous melody of the gay warm company within contracts with the howling of the pitiless storm. You have at length found the door but how woeful your appearance as the light falls on you. Dare you knock in such a plight at such a house. You are ragged and mud splashed and slouched","
who love you, in pagan lands or christian lands - I had almost said, in heaven or hell- that man would sit in the best place in the warmest end of your heart. Ah would'nt he Bradley. I know he would. Where then should you put Jesus Where have you put him? Is he not too often pushed aside among the dear, airy nothings in the most confused corner of your heart? Ah how truly it may be said of thousands who say, Jesus is mine, ""I know not where they have laid him"". The good man who left his company for awhile to lead you to his fireside and lovingly tended you, him you will remember with steady deep love while memory lasts; but Jesus who came away from his home in heaven, as happy a home as God was able to make, him you do not love so much, nor even as much as you would love me were I to walk down to your place some fine day and ask you how you did. How ungrateful and unreasonable. The benevolent man who blessed you with so many kindnesses was only a sinful fellow mortal some gold and some friends; perhaps attracted by that gold and some other things soon to
perish and pass away made the only sig- nificent difference between you, But Jesus is the son of God. ""By him the worlds were made"". By him all things consist ""He it is who seeks you and suffers for you to save you.' Again, you begged the good man to have pity on you, besides you never did him any harm. But it was long ere you ever begged Jesus to help you that he came away here to bless you. So far from humbly begging assistance in time of need, You said, ""I desire notthe knowledge of thy ways"", ""I need nothing from you"". Do not these things make mighty odds in favor of Jesus in the claim for gratitude and love. The good man came only to the door when it stormed; that was not much of a deed. But Christ came far from his home, and out into the storm - a far greater and more bitter storm than we are able to conceive of and remains out in it all his life on earth - going about doing good drinking deep of every sorrow, with no place to lay his head at night, loving all of us, meekly suffering every kind of wrong and abuse, his kindest words and deeds misjudged

Letter from Charles Reid to John Muir, 1858 Feb 9","
[4]got my dinner and so I was in a greater hurry thanever Well I went along again, and got the shoe fixed on my sledge and comming home met some of the scholars and asked them if you was there, and they said yes so I hurryed along to get up you when I was past the school a piece I happen to look and a head pops out of the school door which I thought belonged to Divid but he did not seem to mind me so I drove on done gone again I guess you thought that bashfulness was the cause I must confess John I have rather an extra share of it which sometimes makes me as comfortable as a half boiled Lobster. [Illegible] when will I ever get married John John that is a puzzler and it has a very small share of my thoughts so it must pass without answering but I hope when it becomes needful bashfulness will not keep me from it. But perhaps it will not be amiss for me to say the same thing. When will you ever get married hoping to get an invitation in your next letter60 [1]Buffalo February 9th 1858The bashful gentleman Mr John MuirEsq.Dear Sir,I laughingly take the pen once more into my hand to write you a part of the new valley as David calls it. I am enjoying good health joling along doing whatever comes to hand. We had a job overhauling our co[illegible] but it is over now. I thank you for your poem but I was sorry to see the great difference between the ancient and our modern poets. The former used to set all their powers of wit and learning to work whenever they thought of making the girls the subject of their poem. They would dwell upon
[2]their beauty and refinements and all their charms and lovely perfections till dear me they [illegible] be to over [head?] and ears [illegible] with the very poem. But the modern alas, alas what a change. change did I say yes change. confounded change. I blush to think of it they take what they call their very faults and rhyms them and then speak them with great vehemence and energy even before the girls very faces. One of their what they call faults is the way the girls dress what imprudence just as if the girls had not a right to dress as they have a mind to [illegible] talks about their hoops and spin it out till they seemed to make one think they were going to get up a Locomotive and Roadsall (tail first if you please) to take a journey around them. Excuse me John but perhaps [illegible]secipro- cated love was the cause of your rhyming against the sweet little creatures. To love is painful that is[3]true. Not to love is painful to. But oh! it gives the greatest pain To love and not be loved again. I am sorry John I did not call in as I might have seen the face of a young female of eighteen with blue eyes and fair hair flowing in lines of beauty from the parting of the fair forehead to the exquis[illegible] ears and then falling in a cataract of golden glory over her shining shoulders with eyes full of love [illegible] as the deep sea and as fathomless in their deep dark beauty her well poised head and noble neck with [illegible] half maidenly half womanly in its undulating graces the rounded form altogether presenting a manifestation of womanly glory and loveliness that could have had its ideal only in the refined and passionate imaginations of the poet John Muir Esqr. and has turned him taporilterie. But I did not get your letter till next day at night and that morning I was in a hurry to get their and the horses were always sliping so I had to let them walk at night I was on foot and late next morning I was in as big a hurry with George and his horses. coming home again I had not",""

I suppose this is your best one. and I think it is very good I wont worried it this time so your hopes is fulfilled. You said you could only use yourself a week longer as a wisdom bin and as that time is past now I would advise you to take care and not lose anything out of it for they are precious bins. I hope your bin is as large in proportion as the wheat bin you talk of making and I hope you will not keep it all shut up but used it as occasion requires it so your neighbors will see the great benefit of it. well what nextturn over

You wished me to tell you in my letter how I know it gives so much pain to love and not be loved again all I can say about that is I have heard it said that those who were in that disease seemed to be pained very much about it as for having an experience- ed heart [illegible] John what have you been thinking on that is out of the road altogether but John as I make a kin of confident of you I may tell you I got a kiss in a dream and it being the first I ever experience- ed real or imaginary it gave me such a fright that it waked me up so you[3]see I aint drilled much to the [illegible] yet. I have been very particular in addressing your questions though it tickled me some so so I have been chopping some now days William and I cut one it was four feet through at the butt and when we cut it of 12 feet longe it was 3 feet through and I think times must have changed greatly since it was a g[illegible] The Indians I suppose must have been thick around here then perhaps at has been a [illegible] tree for many a happy couple and where two hostile tri[illegible] met and made a peace nay perhaps it is so old that it was the only one standing then and maybe they had it all flowing over with strings of beads with a seat of honour near the top where each chief sat and made a speech and then",""

[4]John who was the inventor of nonsense if you know just thank him for this letter I must say I never experienced his help so much as since I commence blethering out letters to you. I guess I have read the most of your book that we have, it is a very interesting history there is in it manny sudden raising and fallings of empires many great and [poops?] battles. many noble and mean [Captians?] and Generals many wise and ignorant Kings. I wish I had the other volumes. If you have any hope you will let me have them if you are through with them John always forgets to take his one home. William has got a letter from you by [Hendry?] but there is a part of it so dull that he cannot make it out so[illegible] is rather small please write a little sooner this time you need not waite till you get an afternoon to write one all nice and sleek just sit down some night and illegible[abble] it out rough and ready just as it comes and long to mind that and try and scare me [illegible] or [illegible] never mind. no more off present [illegible] remains your famous [illegible]Charles Reid[1][Rossie?] Dale March 10th 18081.

0234Jeddo PrairieMay 5th 1858 Jeddo PrairieMy DearMy Dear friend JohnI received you kind letter on Sunday and was glad to see it which I read with great delight, the spring don't seem to come on as fast as we thought at first, however the grass, bushes and the trees are beginning to look quite green again it is a time of reviving of every thing thing. Temproral and Spiritual seems to bud out together. I hope they may continue to go on from spring to summer, and then have a good harvest in Autumn have a good harvest from the ground, and a good harvest of Souls into Christ's kingdom, it gladdens the heart of christians to see sinners flocking to the standard King Channel and there to rally round their baptism and fight the good fight of faith, and in that cause in which so many noble martyrs died defending, it is the noblest warfare that any one can be engaged in, it is the only war in which every soldier receives a reward, and every one that dies is kindly taken care of, for at his death Angels are standing ready to cary their souls to heaven whenever it is separated from the body, it is the only one that can give peace to the mind on a dying pillow, what a difference in the death of the martyrs and the enfidils, the one meeting death with a smile, the other in an agony of mind which is worse than the tortures which some of the martyrs were put to, for the cause of their beloved master, but it was only the opening of the gates of [bliss?] a never ending happiness, a never ending fellowship with their God, and their Saviour Jesus Christ and with angels, and all the redeemed of the Lord, let us take example of these martyrs and be determined that what ever comes in our way to hinder us to serve615
the Lord, and ask him to aid us by the influence ofhis Holy Spirit for without him we can do nothing what great hove for sinners hath the Lord that he spared not his only begotten son, but freely gave him up to die for such rebeluous creatures as we are, that he who created all things and made us, should condescend so far as to take upon himself the form of his creatures, and to come down from his throne on high, and travel this world and endure all the sufferings, and trials which men have to endure here on earth. and to die an ignominous death to satisfy an offended God, when we could not do it ourselves, it was great love, yes John great was that love to men who had sinned so much against the Lord, even when they were nailing him to the cross he prayed to his father to forgive them for they knew not what they were doing, it is our duty then to live here in this world to his praise and glory and ask the great God who made us by prayer to send his Holy Spirit to dwell in our hearts to lead and guide us in the paths of holiness, and also to give us faith, strong faith, for without faith it is impossible to please God, we may be laughed at and persecuted by the world but that need not trouble us, Christ told his disciples that they would be persecuted for his names sake, but he will give them strength to bear all their persecutions, blessed are they that will endure to the end for they will receive a crown of glory which the righteous judge will place upon their heads at the last day, it is a blessed voage the voage to the promised land, and that saviour that walked on the seas is able to steer us safely to that haven of rest where we can be free from all the temptations of sin, and from all the storms and tempests of a sinful world.

[], March 18, 1859.Dear friend John:I have delayed ans[wering] your letter so long that I am almost ashamed to write, but I suppose it is better to write now than never. But I hope you will excuse me for being so negligent, I can hardly tell why I have not written, I have thought a great many times I would write, but some way or other I kept putting it off until now. You wrote that you were going to speculate a little on my backwardness. I think myself that I have been pretty backward about ans[wering] your letter, but you see my ""bump of letter writing is not very large,""When I come tocompare my letters with yours I hardly think they will pass for an answer. However you will have to accept this for one. We are all pretty well. I have felt rather dull for a day or two since school has been out.
we have been splitting rails. I have not seen you down this way in quite a while I suppose you are busy Constructing Clocks saw mills etc I hope you will have good success in that business.
